To view the assignment (after starting the application) go to:

[http://localhost:9000/travel/index.html](http://localhost:9000/travel/index.html)

Instructions 
=================

- First start the api mock.

- Start backend with: `./gradlew bootRun`

- Start frontend with: `ng serve` from the frontend directory.

Solution Description
=================
I was not able to complete all the requirements due to my time availability, so I gave priority
to implement a very basic backend that communicates with the api mock. And also a very basic UI
implemented with AngularJS 7 + Angular Material.

Pending Tasks
=================
- Application usage statistics.
- Integrate AngularJS build with gradle.
- All of the bonus points.
